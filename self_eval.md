# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
*Very confident with built-in methods*
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
*Confident with writing simple methods*
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
*Is there an easier way to determine if the return is implicit or explicit? The way I am processing an explicit return is if there is a formula then another line of code to execute what the formula is doing, oulined example below? Methods are reusable, making them very useful and powerful.*

def square(num)
  expo = num ** 2 **line i'm calling the formula**
  p expo
end

square(8)
